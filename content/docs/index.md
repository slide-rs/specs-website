Here you can find API documentation and the rendered book for the latest
master and the latest releases.

Unfortunately, the docs lack examples and detailed
explanations at the moment. In case you're willing to help out,
we're happy to accept a PR.

If you have any question which isn't addressed in the docs or the book,
feel free to ask for help on Gitter or for a new chapter for our book.

## API documentation

This is the rendered documentation with dependencies included.
Please note that documentation for master might be lag behind.

* [master](docs/master/specs/)

## The Specs Book

Intended to be an introduction for beginners, explaining both ECS and
Specs API. It's not complete yet, but it's goal is to build up a small
game at the end.
